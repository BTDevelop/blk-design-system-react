          In our template product, we have two navbars that can be found inside{" "}

          It is used to create the navbar / header that appears on the{" "}
          <code className="highlighter-rouge">src/layouts/Admin/Admin.jsx</code>{" "}

            src/components/Sidebar/Sidebar.jsx
          </Link>{" "}
          from closed to open on small devices. It also has a dynamic brand and
          a prop called <code className="highlighter-rouge">sidebarOpened</code> to
          let it know when the{" "}
          <Link to="/documentation/sidebar">

        <p>
          So if you want to use it, be sure to send all the above props to it.

          This is how it should look like in your render function of your

          Beside the brand text which comes as a props, everything else in this
          component is static, and none of the componnets used in it have any
          sort of functionality - this is something you should add based on the
          project you are working on, so you will need to manually change things
          if you want, so feel free to change this component as you wish.
